Thanks to Holger Assenmacher for the patch for 10.5.0.
 

Configuration
=============

Edit "/etc/miniupdate.conf" to your needs.

Run "/usr/sbin/miniupdate -v" to check for errors.

Modify the init scripts to your situation. Like program path...etc. 

Run miniupdate using the init scripts.


Firewall Setting
================
If miniupdate is run behind a firewall, you must allow it to send outgoing packets to 9120/tcp 
and 9121/udp.


Feature
=======
miniupdate monitors the IP address of your external interface, and update the DNS record if the 
address changed. It also supports the "behind a router" situation: it can sense the IP 
address of the router's external interface by sending a udp request to the myip server 
of minidns.net.
